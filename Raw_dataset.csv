4)The order is still in new status in SIMS, please advise if we should void in our system first, or if we should wait for gShip cancellation. 

Let me know if other details are needed.
Also, please look into this issue and advise if there a bug that could affect other orders, or if this was a "" one time thing"".

38931872,Assembly completion error- HELP,"Hello Ascii team,

Need your help urgently as this assembly completion error is gating our ability to ship parts to our data centers for upgrades.

Here's a summary of the process for Hawksbill....

The card 1025651-03 ships from Cavium (Supplier) to our Oakley Hub, It's then MOR'd to our NYC office (which is set up as a CM).
Our NY office provisions the cards and changes the PN to 1027739-03 and then does assembly completion and MOR units back to Oakley so the units can be shipped to the various DCs for upgrades.

We have been doing this for a couple of years now so not sure why we're having Assembly completion issues now. Can you please help ?
We need to resolve this issue asap so units can ship out of NYC office. This process has previously worked without any assembly completion issues on PN 1025651-01 and 1025651-02 and 1027739-01 and 1027739-02. We now have an issue with the  1025651-03 and 1027739-03 and need your help.

Agile BOM set up is correct. 
1025651-03 - Supply type is NPI consigned ; Oracle Template is Ops Purchased
1027739-03- Supply type is NPI consigned ; Oracle Template is Ops CM Make

PO issued was an OSP PO.

Here's the issue we're facing....
Our assembly-complete of 30 pcs of 1027739-03 failed with this error, "" SCP00425ERROR: Onhand Quantity not sufficient for item 1025651-03 in Org ZOR. There are indeed 30 units of 1025651-03 under ZOR ( CMGONY1P) to cover this Assembly Completion. Please help fix the error that is causing this failure. 

Appreciate it.

Thanks,

NormYes, PO# 5000088. Thanks Aditya.Hi Helen/ Norm

I see the blanket PO # 5000088 in the SC Portal. However, I couldn't find the AC transaction in Oracle with respective GPNs.
Could you let me know if there were any AC transactions reported against the PO # 5000088 in SC Portal with the items? Also can you provide the screenshot where you have seen the error message?

AdityaHi Aditya,
I don't think it created a transaction before, it did not go that far.  It failed on the ""validate"" step.
Just now I tried it again (to get the screenshot) -- and it worked! SCP37354 has been created.
I guess the problem fixed itself, whatever it was.

Was this Order actually supposed to be canceled? Can we have it reopened to allow it to complete?

Yes  we can cancel this order completely 
i can recreate a new order once its status changes to Cancelled. 

Thanks,
MANU Manvinder:

The order is complete in XPO's system, which means that it has already shipped and been received at the destination. We cannot cancel an order that has physically shipped. We need to reopen this order in gShip to have it complete there. Then you can work with the destination warehouse to have it returned if that's what needs to happen.

Order MORSC4492774999 is complete in XPO SIMS, but was canceled in gShip. Please reopen the order to allow it to complete.

When this order is complete, if necessary, work with the receiving warehouse to have the order reversed.

Hi,
ASN have already been sent with ICN - 200740902

https://screenshot.googleplex.com/ADFf1bD9L14Hi Vikrant, 

ASN 253462 failed as the ASN is already used in WMS. Please request the supplier to create a new ASN for example ( 253462.1).


Regards, 

Jasmine 
Hi Jasmine,

I can see earlier ASN 253462 was sent for PO 487096.
This is valid scenario and Syncreon's system should be able to handle it since the PO is different and different suppliers may use the same shipment number generated by their own systems.write on of 5 complete per request of dan humberd. thanks kristina for handling the syncreon side.  to update gooogle/gship, i did a po receipt on the po which left a 5 unit delta in the system.  syncreon wrote the inventory on to main but the po was created to an npi project code.  see screenshot - image.png

to fix this i did this transformation to move the oracle inventory to MAIN: https://supplychain.google.com/central/u/0/ims/transactions/detail?trxId=880fb226-7abd-4281-aa9d-d0ec84fab326&from=eyJzdGF0ZSI6Imltcy10cnguaGlzdG9yeSIsInBhcmFtcyI6eyJmcm9tVGltZSI6IjE1NTQ5NTUyMDAwMDAiLCJ0b1RpbWUiOiIxNTU1MDQxNjAwMDAwIn19

after these two transactions the inventory is available in oracle and wms for orders.  see screenshot image(1).png

Hi Andrew,

I'm not sure why the ticket is being bounced back and forth to Techstop as Metis application is part of ASCII and created a confusion.


Hi ASCII and shritesh@,

The reason I attached the g3doc just because the previous update mentioned that ""ASCII Oracle support does not support METIS application"". VST and Techstop, I would say, can create a bug for this but I think ASCII would be the right team to support and initiate the request with oncall team as they would have more context of the app. Thanks for reaching out to ASCII Oracle Support team for help.

As per process standardization, We need answers to the below point. 
Please provide the same to cancel MOR.

1) Please specify Google PA (NetOps, Datacenter, Fiber, Consumer Hardware)
2) Can you please provide justification of Move Order Cancellation?
3) What will be the impact if this Move order is not Cancelled?
4) Is this order cancelled in partner system?

Request you to fill the same for any upcoming MOR cancellation requests.

Regards,
SurendraHello Surendra,
I confirm the first question yes, all the box ID' s need to be cancelled and the consequent order also cancelled in portal.

1) These are all LTO7 Disk Erase Drives, that are flagged as Spares, I would say this are consumable Hardware, is there a place where I can confirm the PA of a GPN?
2) Dejavu has created the labels with destination WHNLAMSPM - A HUB at Amsterdam, instead of our WH as it should be. SC Portal generated an order to the same destination. The correct process is this Material should go to our SPOKE: WHBEGHPM, and then we create another MTR from our SPOKE to the VENDOR, not the HUB.
3) The parts will be blocked in SIMS even if we cancel the order. Keeping logistics to ship to the VENDOR, or we follow up and ship to AMS hub where they do not have the tools to process the parts.
4) It is not cancelled in partner system yet, it is in NEW status, so that the changes you make can be refelcted, we can cancel as soon as you advise so.

Will do for future Order cancellations.

 The project code is no longer in the B2B code it is in a different field in FT, due to the enhancements we are in the middle of testing, and that is why they are not closing in GShip.

These will need to be manually closed in GShip until the enhancements are complete

We are facing a challenge concerning order: FMTR0000949719.2.

WHNLAMSPM.

Now OB has been voided in SIMS but I am unable to recreate an order for
Amsterdam in RMA portal.

Could you please let us know if it's possible to release the 8 pieces
blocked in portal or I need to do the OB with Gship as the parts are
available on this way.

1) Please specify Google PA (NetOps, Datacenter, Fiber, Consumer Hardware)

It concern Consumer Hardware

2) Can you please provide justification of Move Order Cancellation?

Order was created with a wrong destination, Fairburn instead Amsterdam

3) What will be the impact if this Move order is not Cancelled?

As It concerns RMA parts, we can't keep the parts more of 15 days. This can affect the SLA we have with customer and our metrics.

4) Is this order cancelled in partner system?

Yes Order is voided in SIMS, I need now the parts available in portal in order to send the parts in the good destination.


Thank a lot

Hello IT team, SCPTeam,


We are facing a challenge concerning order: FMTR0000949719.2.

Due to an error of associate, destination WHGAFB1PM was entered instead
WHNLAMSPM.

Now OB has been voided in SIMS but I am unable to recreate an order for
Amsterdam in RMA portal.

Could you please let us know if it's possible to release the 8 pieces
blocked in portal or I need to do the OB with Gship as the parts are
available on this way.

Thanks!Hi Bonnie,

We can resolve / void the transaction with 40 units, and then play MR in gShip UI for 39.
Order will then be closed normally.

Let us know if you approve Supports to transact MR for 39 units.

ValerieNicole will confirm that is the correct action to take.  But what about the remaining 2 qty that had been waiting to be received?  They will not be associated with a MOR.  How will they be received?Approve to transaction MR for remaining 39 to close out MOR

Bonnie, after this is complete, check delta var and adjust for the 1 (if needed)Bonnie & Nicole,

MORSC3921542404 is now fully received and closed.

Please proceed with next step.Resolving ticket as there's no further action required from Supports.

We had a delta of qty 10 tied to this transaction in WHNLAM.

Analysis:
Based on analysis by Rohit in jda, we can see that the material was received on LPN [NLAM300053IS] and that it was eventually shipped. However, no MR was fired to Host against that MOR. We believe jda got stuck in send_error status and it was not seen acted upon before the error was purged.	

Proposed fix:
Play the MR in gShip / IMS to match jda.

Fixed:
swessels processed manual MR in gShip

38791915,Play MR of MORSC4037271143 - line 3 (07108229),"
The MR for MORSC4037271143 - line 3, GPN 07108229 had failed due to incorrect serials on the transaction.

The issue was originally worked on ticket 37798323 but was closed prior to fix due to lack of response.



The Delta Team at WHNLAM3 is correcting this delta and proposes the following fix:

 ** Please play a MR in Oracle/IMS using the serials that are in IWHNLAM3P (as sent in original MT) **




Once those are received, we will play an IMS transformation to adjust the serial numbers to match the correct serials on the box.

As per the transformations records we could see the MR record from JDA and below serials are reported for Line #3, GPN: 07108229 on 2019-01-03 09:10:38 UTC.

Could you please confirm if the material is physically received and the actual serial received.

Thanks,
PravinPravin,

Yes - the material is on hand and received in JDA at WHNLAM3, with the serials reported in the MR on 2019-01-03. The issue, as you know, is the serials passed in the MT from XPO don't match those in the MR. 

If you can post an MR using the serials as they exist in the MT then we can fix the serials on hand in IMS. We can't do it while they are in transit though. We did a similar fix in t/38047513 for TNCK1 and it worked well.

Could you please help.

Ram2 minutes, not 2 hours, are meant.

We want to understand why or how the timing of Inventory Transaction Manager is set to 5 minutes. (in EBSUAT, the timing was set to 2 minutes.)

What could be the minimum timing that will work for EBS Prod?Hi William

Currently the material transaction manager launch is scheduled for every 5 mins. The schedule was unchanged from when we took up  the ascii support. The schedule can be changed to 2 mins. Per Oracle, it can be scheduled in 2, 5 or 10 mins. When we have huge uncosted transactions, we usually flip the timing of Cost Manager from 2 to 1 minute.

2 minutes for inventory transaction manager should work in transaction processing in Oracle. If you need any more details, please let me know.

Hi Tiana,

Could you please provide more information about the restriction on the POs? I am not sure what restriction you are talking about here so I can't check on the POs.
I don't have access to t/30711035.Support Team, 

As per my conversation with Tiana, I'm providing the details below regarding those PO's which having issue (Restriction in Oracle) of not sending PO ASN (EDI) out to CM.

PO#1010008981
Supplier : TTM TECHNOLOGIES TRADING ASIA COMPANY LIMITED
Supplier Site :  HONG KONG USD  [Site ID : 1555905]

Below query retrieves supplier site IDs from the table which is stopping the PO ASN [EDI] sending out to CM.
SELECT * 
FROM xxmfg.xxmfg_asn_sf_wolf_loc_codes 
WHERE supplier_site_id in (1652835,176497, 1555905);

Please remove these supplier site IDS (above) from the table to resolve this ticket similar to the solution provided in some old ticket [t/30711035+Satya

Hi Santosh,

removing these sites from xxmfg_asn_sf_wolf_loc_codes means marking these supplier sites as non integrated. Any new PO created for these suppliers sites will also send PO ASN to 3PL post change but if supplier is reporting ASN via scportal/E2open, it will not be sent to 3PL.
So please confirm you want to make these changes.


Thanks,
Vikrant Hi Vikranth,

I just spoke to Satya as well. He has agreed that the scope of this ticket should

1. Disable these supplier sites (set active_flag = N) in the table xxmfg_asn_sf_wolf_loc_codes.
2. Generate PO ASN (EDI for total quantity) to CM for only these 3 PO's  (520217, 1010009757, 1010008981)
3. Enable these supplier sites (set active_flag = Y) back in the table.     (Otherwise In case if not enabled,  it would impact other PO's using the same supplier site)

Please go-ahead and confirm.

Regards,
Santosh.Thanks Santosh. Let me work on this.Thanks Santosh & VikrantHi Tiana,

This is completed and ASNs have been sent to Inventec with ICNs 200006801,200006800 and 200006799

The structure reported in the ASN is incorrect, it should be shipment - order - item but it has been mentioned as shipment- item - order in the OUTBOUND ASN sent to Syncreon.

When I checked for the corresponding inbound ASN file, we are receiving it from ""INNOLIGHT TECHNOLOGY SUZHOU LTD"" through e2open and it is non-EDI also there are no structure details mentioned in the inbound ASN.

This is the same case for all the inbound ASN's which we are receiving through e2open and the corresponding ASN_Of also having the structure  shipment- item - order which is incorrect, but so far only syncreon reported this issue and we didn't here from any other partner yet.

Hi team,

There is an issue with MORSC4489550598. It is on Sent status in gShip.
Initially I thought that order had not been confirmed in shipping warehouse
(WHNLSR1P) SIMS, but apparently is has been. As the order is stuck on Sent
status, it means that we cannot inbound the order, as there is no inbound
in our system.

Could you take a look at this as soon as possible?

Hi Michelle,

Should the warehouse create order to WHJPOS1RK.MAIN then proceed to ship to WHNLAMSRK.MAIN ?

Thanks.

7022232-R. Disposition is Defective, with instructions to consolidate in Amsterdam
7022226-R. Disposition is Scrap, no consolidation instructions. 

For 7022226-R, follow typical local scrap processes. No need to consolidate in Amsterdam. 

For 7022232-R, this should be dispositioned as remarket and consolidated at the hub per typical reverse processes. Yes, they should be shipped to WHNLAMSRK.MAIN.   Hi,

Warehouse team tried to create order, but it does not show Disp location, so can we have any advice on this?

I attached screen shot, so will you please refer on that?

I tried to proceed on this RMA this morning, but I could not find proper selection on ¨ Name ¨ and could not put check mark on ¨ Create MO ¨ like it seems staying as grey and not clickable, so I would like to know how we could proceed on this. 

For ¨ name ¨, Which one should I select or no need to select anything here? 
Just in case, it´s Finiser product, MPN : FTLX8572D3BCL-G1.

If you could help me on this, it would be grateful.

Thanks
Masa

Hi Henri, As checked, Both the shipments # MORSC4486294503 &

MORSC4486311935 are having same order number # 1000000223 and SIMS wont

allow duplicate order numbers to be loaded. Also, we can see that one order

with Order Number # 1000000223 is already loaded in SIMS and is completed.

TO load this order number, you will have to change the Order numbers and

then resend the same from GShip to SIMS. Attached is the screenshot of the

completed order.



If this is an emergency, please contact us by phone at +1 877-624-3577.

Please proivde proper business justification why the ASNs were over receipted?

Also, please provide Gaurav's approval before we do the reversal.Keva@ could you please provide the justification? Thanks, Luciana-.Vikrant, 

The receiver processed the order against the ASN in WMS instead of the ASN they physically had. The receiver was not paying attention to the ASN shipped, and instead received against the ASN available. Also, the ASN shipped was not systemically inserted into WMS, therefore the receiver thought it was ok to receive against what was available. Please advise if anymore information is needed for this approval.

Please approve this reversal.Hi Luciana,

Are you aware of this over-receipt issue?

GauravHi Gaurav, I pinged you yesterday regarding this issue. I'm aware of this issue since last Friday when I had a call with Keva and Tresa to help them solve this - PIVT is actually showing less units than the total requested/shipped, so I couldn't caught this issue on time. Apparently there was an issue with the ASNs, that can only be resolved by backing out the receipts. See Keva's explanation below:

How is there only 6480 units on the PO right now?Tresa,

On further analysis, I can see there was a PO receipt for Qty 3520 got processed for this PO.
This transaction was sent by XPO in EDI ICN 377231867 on 02/18. This PO receipt was in error because qty was not available on PO line to be received.So as soon as we reverted the receipts, this transaction got processed as it found the sufficient opened qty on PO line.

Appreciate your support.Indira, we need urgent attention to this.

There were shipment MORSC4060378348 sent to GNZAKL04O that are now being re-routed to IE location.
What do we need to do to fix this? Hi Valerie,

Can you please check this?Tresa,

Both orders are failing because the from location GNZAKL04O is not valid.
GNZAKL04O is the physical location with warehouse, hence, can't generate a Material Receipt from this location.

Should from location is GIERAT01W, a CORP-NETOPS and not an inventory location.

Please confirm then we'll update and reprocess.

ValerieHi Valerie
Please proceed as you suggested

Thanks
Best Regards
Dave Hi Dave,

We updated the from location to GIERAT01W and both 2045020W 2044039W are now processed.

Looks like this is a recurrence of an old issue where the PO goes into Requires Reapproval state as part of processing the EDI commits signal. Can you please look into how such POs were fixed in the past? Also, please log a RCA bug to look into why this issue happened again.Thanks for reaching out to ASCII Oracle Support team for help. This ticket has been triaged by Ticketron, a Google AI powered solution. For more information, please visit go/ticketron.Hi All

I am looking into this incident. I shall provide you an update at the earliest.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Aditya,

Please treat this as high priority as we have shipments pending for receiving due ASN failures.

Thanks!Hi Sunil

Please find the below observations.

I could see that shipments were cancelled against PO # 1010015647 with cancel reason 'EDI Signal Cancel'. However, the quantity wasn't received against any of these shipments. Earlier we had a bug # 71770762 where the shipments got cancelled after the creation of receipts. To overcome this, Oracle suggested a datafix to restore a cancelled PO shipment. As the quantity was not received now, the PO shipment can be deleted and entered in the application.

Root cause: The ASL setup against GPN # 1027766 has been created on 25th March which has the consigned flag as 'Y'. However, the GPN attribute 'Consigned' at the org level has been set to 'N'.  Here are the screenshots for your reference.

https://screenshot.googleplex.com/C64p3uxxU4C.png

https://screenshot.googleplex.com/1aSs7NCMWxP.png

To fix this, the consigned attribute needs to be set to 'Y' or the consigned flag in ASL setup needs to be unchecked to 'N'.

Could you please review and advise on this?

Thanks,
Aditya+Smita

Hi Smita,

As Sunil is OOO, can you help us on this?

Thanks!Couldn't do much analysis since I am out of office, but here are a couple questions on Aditya's analysis:
When you say that the root cause is the discrepancy between ASL setup and GPN attribute for 1027766, what exactly is this impacting? 
The shipments getting cancelled due to the EDI signal is expected behavior. PO going into Requires Reapproval has also been observed before. Is the consigned flag somehow preventing you from deleting the shipment to fix this PO status?Hi Sunil,

Thanks for looking into it.

Buyer was able to submit the PO again for approval by deleting shipment
lines in Oracle. However, we would like to have the root cause analysis and
what can be done to avoid this in future?

Thanks,
Harika

MORSC4073487053 is now closed in gShip after correcting the serials for line 6 and 7.

MORSC4077638558 line 6 has not been received.  Can you confirm if it was received in DBS?


Rdgs,
ValerieValerie,

MORSC4077638558 line 6 (GPN: 86003552 ) was received.

Regards,
MartinMartin,

We re-processed MR for MORSC4077638558 line 6 in gShip.

Order is now completed and closed.

Rdgs,
ValerieValerie,

I believe when you re-processed that MOR it added inventory (GPN: 86003552) that doesn't match what is in the warehouse. See screenshots below:

WMS Inventory: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/338gOLvF8Ld    (Correct)
Oracle Inventory: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/0aYqKSPqRbe   (Incorrect)

Regards,
Martin Martin,

We can't interpret the WMS screen.

Completing line 6 put 3 x 86003552 to location WHTNCK1P project WH-SPARES-H.

Per your confirmation it was received in WMS so we processed it gShip.

Could there be a misunderstanding that this line was not received in WMS?

Rdgs,
ValerieValerie,

My apologies for any misunderstanding. The correct inventory for the WH is qt 6. Oracle should reflect:

3 qt. in WH-Spares-H 
3 qt. in C3219

Regards,
Martin 
Hi Martin,

GPN             Location        Project         Qty
86003552	WHTNCK1P	C3217	        3
86003552	WHTNCK1P	WH-SPARES-H	3
86003552	WHTNCK1P	C3219	        3

So there's an extra 3 x in C3217.
These 3 were last received into Oracle via order MORSC4059484750.

Can you check status of this order in WMS?

ValerieValerie,

MORSC4059484750 was processed in and out of WHTNCK1 prior to us going live with WMS. Project code C3217 (3qt) should be 0.

MartinHi Martin,

Hi Valerie, According to Brett at XPO the location=WHMOKCAF and project=MAIN is what they received for project and owner code.   Will you be doing the necessary correction in GF apps?Hi Bonnie,

Actually, shipment 4400074751 has 2 lines,  183 x 86006640-01 and 183 x 86006640-02.
We updated the location to WHMOKCAF for both and the shipment is processed in Oracle now.

Valerie, You meant qty on line 2 for 136.  (not the 183 like line 1)  EDI had >>>RCD*2*136*EA~. Pls check your entryBonnie,

please check if the Flat file ASN is sent for this MTR as UGEN is not on EDI.Hi Arti

ASN against order # MTR0000942550 has been transmitted through outbound file # 574627.txt.

Could you please check with Unigen IT team on the same?

Thanks,
AdityaHello Aditya,

Thank you for information. So, does it mean there would not be any ASN? Can you help to understand how these move orders would be received by Unigen?

Thanks,
ArtiHi Arti

As 'Unigen' is not an EDI integrated CM, the ASN will be sent through a flat file generated by a concurrent program 'Google MRP Messaging Load To Oracle Inventory' which is placed in Oracle server and the same will be transferred to messaging server.

If you need any more details, please let me know.

ValerieHi Valerie,
Incident INC001963492 has been created.
Regards
RobertoHi Valerie,
I have received the following answer from DBS ServiceNow:

""It seems you deleted the trailer without dispatching it. Because of this MR didn't send to Host.
So we created a new trailer and attached to this trknum and dispatched that trailer. Now MR is sent to Host""

Order is is status ""Closed - Received"" in gShip, hence I am resolving this Ticket.
Thank you

Kind regards
Roberto

If this is not the correct one, will proceed with the new setups.

Thanks,The location code is now populated into GShip. Thanks.  However,the address provided below for HYNIX_RMA_HK is similar to the one I submitted but the order/format is different.  Personally I think the address format in our system needs to be amended to match exactly the address provided by the vendor.

Additionally, this location code still is not populated into Supply Chain/RMA portal, only GShip. Needs to be in portal as well.Thanks Christopher for the confirmation.

Regards,
SurendraYes the location code provided (HYNIX_RMA_HK) is for the disposition ship to location.  

For the FROM location: I am at XPO-OAKLEY. The FROM location code is WHGAOAKPM for outbound RMA orders. Hi Christopher,

Indira:

Youre just fooling me this morning.  I looked for MORSC4488363640 in both Production and Test.  Then I looked closer at the locations involved.  This is for the Netherlands  Amsterdam.  All Amsterdam Orders are not routed to the syncreon EDI system.  They are routed to Pandora JDA instead.  So, I will never see them.

For all Fairburn Operations related inquiries, please include InventoryQueries.Fairburn@syncreon.com<mailto:InventoryQueries.Fairburn@syncreon.com>  for Fairburn DC in your e-mail distribution list for faster response.  For AS2 or EDI translation related issues relating to Fairburn, please include edi@syncreon.com<mailto:edi@syncreon.com> and servicedesk@syncreon.com<mailto:servicedesk@syncreon.com> in your e-mail distribution list.

For all Amsterdam Operations & EDI related inquiries, please include:
Ajay Kumar <ajaykumartank@google.com<mailto:ajaykumartank@google.com>>
Rohit Rathee rrathee@google.com<mailto:rrathee@google.com>

Jerry.Kenton@syncreon.com<mailto:Jerry.Kenton@syncreon.com>
inventoryqueries.amsterdam@syncreon.com
Inventory is now being controlled by the Pandora JDA/WMS system and the Amsterdam transactions no longer are processed via Syncreon systems.

To help in your search, Im including the Amsterdam contacts in the distribution list.  Perhaps they can find MORSC4488363640.

Thanks and Happy Friday,

MOR# CMORSC4077072987.1, we added the Inventory for 1 QTY (Line# 15, GPN 07006513) in JDA.
And confirmed that all inventory is physically received in warehouse.
Even though you sent two ASN to us, we can't able to receive two ASN for one MOR.
SO could you please adjust your inventory qty at your end?

Thank you.

38656845,Transformation transaction for HWOPS and DCOPS Spare parts- 03/26,"Hi , 

Below is the list of spares transactions to DT/HT.MAIN. Since this are moved from Spoke to DT/HT.MAIN, material is not consumed. This inventory in DT/HT.MAIN is pegging against demands and causing planning delays. 

We are working with logistics to stop this kind of MOR's in future. In the last couple of weeks the number of incorrect transactions decreased by about 95%. So we are only seeing 5-10 incorrect MOR's each week. 

Would you please help to clean up the inventory by  performing 'transformation transaction'  against DCOPS SPARES and SPARESP for inventory at DC%DT and DC%HT .

Below Update statement has been executed in EBSPROD.
Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Team, 

THIS IS CONTINUATION FROM P1S1 BUG, do you have any reason why this ticket in S3, why urgency is changed to low?

You have to execute the update and you need to re-process each transaction from SC portal UI. I have mentioned it clearly in the ticket description.

Please consider this on high priority.


Hi KK,
I have raised the ticket with priority High and Urgency High, I am not sure why it has been reduced.

Thanks,
Selva.Hi Selva

Apologies for the inconvenience caused.All the transactions have been reprocessed in the system.
Could you please review and let us know if there are any transactions in error?

Thanks,
AdityaHi Aditya,
None of the orders are processed, did you do it in EBSPROD ? I don't see ""last update date"" column updated to today's date ?

Thanks,
Selva.Hi Selva,

Following query retrieves zero records. 27 records retrieves where from_location is ""WHSFENJAM"" and all 27 records are in ""Processed"" status in this table.

     AND status = 'Error';
Hi team,,
Your query fetches 0 because from_location_code has been updated by Aditya and that is one of the action item. please go through the complete conversation. Please ping me if you have any doubts. Please process all those erred ones, its critical.

Please DO NOT reduce the priority until KK's consent. 

Thanks
Selva.Hi Selva

This is in progress. Will update the thread once the activity is completed.

Thanks for the update, Piyush.

Hi Gergo

Per below update, the field average_age_since_original_receipt is calculated by rounding the current time stamp and the field original date received in Oracle mtl_onhand_quantities_Detail table.

If you need any more details, please let me know.

Thanks,
AdityaHi my question is whether the quantity received in the location is taken into account for example

if we receive 100 gpns in one location (and assume on consumption) and a receipt of 10 of the same GPN in the same location in 5 days  the simple mean and weighted average would differ (mean: 5+1/6 = 3 days , weighted average age: (5*100 + 10*1)/110  =  4.64 days )
(we can argue whether receipt on the day should be counted as 1 or zero but that's beside the point)

ThanksThanks for the update, Gergo.

I am looking into this. I shall provide you an update at the earliest.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Gergo

The value of the GPN is based on a weighted average of receipt costs over the past number of days, starting with the current date. This calculation excludes any cancelled receipts and then averages all of the receipt costs. Also you can perpetually value inventory at an average cost, weighted by quantity (inventory cost = average unit cost * quantity).

For purchased items, this is a weighted average of the actual procurement cost of an item. For manufactured items, this is a weighted average of the cost of all resources and materials consumed.

Hope this clarifies your query. If you are looking for any additional information, please let me know.

Hi Henri, As checked, Both the shipments # MORSC4486294503 &
MORSC4486311935 are having same order number # 1000000223 and SIMS wont
allow duplicate order numbers to be loaded. Also, we can see that one order
with Order Number # 1000000223 is already loaded in SIMS and is completed.
TO load this order number, you will have to change the Order numbers and
then resend the same from GShip to SIMS. Attached is the screenshot of the
completed order.

If this is an emergency, please contact us by phone at +1 877-624-3577.

Hello Indira,  

As per the new process,  all material shipped to DC*HT has to sent from any project to 'WH-SPARES-H'.  The items on the MORSC4487890961 were on MAIN in DCQCLO1HT since these items were transferred to HwOps a long time ago. 

Is there anything else could be done to close the MOR and resolve this issue?

1. Rename the report to PROD_KTN_PLAT_error_DateAndTime
2. Report should be in ""XLS"" format
3. Please ""schedule"" this report daily at 2am, 9am and 3pm to email addresses: raikwar@google.com, hmurarisetty@google.com, neeruj@google.com, Kingston_Ginger@kingston.com (CM)

Hello Suvashish,

There is a report schedule for Kingston (Sorry I was not aware about it earlier), but is not having all the transaction errors you pulled in your report. 
Could you please check why there is discrepancy between two?

Thanks,
ArtiHi Tanmoy,

Can you please run the production error report for Kingston.

Let me know in case of any issues.

Regards,
SuvasishHello Tanmoy,

Just to summarize:
Kingston is receiving the report but there is no data. But the report generated by Suvashish is having data. Could you please help to populate data in daily report ""PROD_KINGSTON_PLAT_error........""

Thanks,
ArtiHi Arti,

I checked the query that is being used to generate the already existing PROD_KINGSTON_PLAT_error report and the query used there is quite different from the one Suvasish used to generate the new report.

@Suvasish - Attaching the query for the already existing report. Can you please take a look at the query and let me know if that is working fine in Oracle and if any changes needs to be done in the existing query.

If this report was run previously, then kindly run it as per demand and  update Arti. Currently the query is not fetching any error records.

Please cancel all the transactions listed in the following spreadsheet - 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oBppawxLZgzDii2QgPP1wXS2lDZqcNm05pVRrRDWfnM/edit?usp=sharing

Reason for cancellation - As per the recent discussion with CYNERGY regarding the annual physical inventory count at their end, we have done mass inventory reconciliation on 24-MAR-19 and have balanced inventory for the ASP CYNERGY. Hence going forward we will be doing variance analysis taking 25-MAR-19 snapshot as the base/latest last_match_date. We need to cancel all the older error/stuck transactions in order to avoid any contribution of them to the discrepancy and to keep a proper sanity check on the transactions beyond 24-MAR-19 which are going to be analyzed both at our and partner's end.

Let me know in case you have any further questions or in case you need approvals.

Are you saying that the original order has been physically completed? If that's so, then we can get the gShip order reopened and allowed to complete (that will clear the inventory delta). Then if the material has to be returned, you can open a new order to do that.

Any and all GPN's in WHDEFR2P should be set up to consolidate at WHNLAMSPM.

Or is it no longer required for me to select WHNLAMSP from the Disp Location drop down menu to create the MO?

kind regards,
PhilippPhilipp,

I don't understand what the problem statement is here, is this an issue with DejaVu?. Yes, GPNs scanned in EU locations should be consolidated in WHNLAMSPM. Please share the GPNs you are experiencing issues with. Hello Jamie,
Let me show you an example of how I was able to create the MO for another site. Please find the attached screenshots where I can open the drop down menu for Disp Location and click on WHNLAMSPM before creating the MO.

Every singe gpn currently awaiting shipment from WHDEFR2PM does not have WHNLAMSPM as a selectable option in the disp location drop down menu in the RMA portal.

WHNLAMSPM disposition location setup has been done for WHDEFR2PM, Please find the attached screenshot.

Please let us know if anything required.

Regards,
SurendraHello Surendra,
Thank you for setting up the disposition. I did encounter a further challenge, if you don't mind taking a look.

I attempted to create a MO for these materials in WHDEFR2PM, however since several hours, it is stuck with the status ""MO Creation Pending.""

I see that the RMA portal indicates on lines 1 and 28 that there are no serials under Details (see screenshot). Is it possible that this is blocking the creation of the MO?

If this is the case, could you kindly cancel the MO creation, and I will resubmit the order without those lines, and create a separate ticket to address the serials?

kind regards,
PhilippHi Philipp,

Lines has been released which are stuck under the WHDEFR2PM.

Regards,
SurendraHi Philipp,

Lines has been released which are stuck under the WHDEFR2PM.

Issue:
1. Disposition location missing for WHDEFR2PM in RMA portal.
2. Lines stuck to create Move Order.

Resolution:
1. Verified the WHNLAMSPM location is available in GGL_RMA_LOCATION_MAPPING lookup and inserted the from_location (WHDEFR2PM) and to_location(WHNLAMSPM) details in XXMFG_SCP_RMA_LOCATIONS table.
2.Deleted the lines which stuck to create MOR from the XXMFG_HW_RMA_INPROCESS_QTY table.

Please provide valid business justification for the reversal of these receipts?Hi Vikrant,

Supplier issued the invoice 48012 and we paid. Then supplier canceled this invoice in the City Hall and replaced with the invoice 48113. We made void the payment of the invoice 48012 and we need to carry out the reversal of the funds in the PO81024971 to then process the correct invoice - 4813.

Tks,
RobertHi Robert,

Reversal of PO is not needed. you just have to match it with the new invoice.
Unmatch it from the voided invoice and rematch with the correct invoice.
why do you think a reversal is needed? will you be matching against a different PO?Hi Vikrant,

Reversal of PO is indeed needed, you have to perform the actin I've asked for.
Inv# 48012 payment was voided and it was cancelled in AP module, leaving a difference between RI and AP, it's clearly visible on PIVT: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/pQTQdjXf7BZ

You have to reverse the receipt #123922 and then we will be able to post the new invoice. For now, we don't have funds, as Oracle is detecting the receipt in RI and preventing us in using PO#81024971.

Business justification: Raising priority to HIGH - we have to close this case until the end of this week and pay the outstanding amount.

please proceed according to my instructions.

thank you,
RobertHi - Please note that Urgent/High priority is reserved only for application down situation so we are downgrading the priority of this issue to Medium.Hi Robert,

I am still trying to understand this request.
If we reverse this receipt then you have to receive this PO again to match with the new invoice 48113 or will you be matching the PO without receiving?
Let me know if this is not the correct understanding.
I am just trying to be sure we are not doing anything not needed in system.Ticket escalated by adding nikhilagrawal, krishmohan, rparthasarathy, arunm, vamsimudumba, psankurathri, sbommisetty, ashishkohli to cc listHi Vikrant,

Please perform the reversal as requested. 
If today we will not have resolved this, it will impact the process of payment and closing of the month of the Brazil unit - because of that I am increasing the priority to urgent.

Hi Aga/Robert,

We can understand that this request is of utmost priority but before doing any changes in system I just want to make sure we are not doing anything in the system which is not needed and can be avoided. Till now I haven't got the answer that will this PO be receipted again in order to match it to another invoice?
We have put in another check in place before doing these receipt reversal. We need an approval before doing these changes in system. hence asked Adam for approval.Once it's approved will do the reversal.

They are over $100k and came for accounting approval today with the note: ""DEN03E Manual adjustment to avoid retirement""

Can you please provide background on what causes these deltas and how they are being corrected with Account Alias 'MRB' today, is possible, as it is quarter end close this Sunday. 

Thanks,

JillHi Nita

Yes. Other 57 are serial tracked parts.

Here is the final list of transformations submitted to clean up DEN03E discrepancies.

https://supplychain.google.com/central/u/0/ims/transactions/transformations/batchCreate?type=QUANTITY_CHANGE&trix=1HkfICfaVHdl0XWAGUrOfG3D-plb6dZ0B8yogi4e7k7M

Clearing the quantity from CMARSNC has been completed and from CMARSNCM is pending. Sorry for the confusion on the other day.

Could you please review the above sheet and approve the same?

Thanks,
AdityaAditya

Please give me access to the sheet shared.  Also I'm not sure I understand why there are transformations related to DEN03E in CMARSNCM.  I also note the delta tab hasn't been updated for a while.  I assume this is probably down to the number of deltas due to DEN03E but i think we should still ensure the delta report to prevent warehouses from shipping parts in delta (DEN03E can always be filtered out).

Could you confirm if you have reviewed and are ok with the transformations being requested?

Jill

These adjustments are related to material collected from DEN03E which was set-up as an expense location code.  

We consulted with John Lux and Grace Collins and they advised that we should bring these parts back at zero cost and that since the valuation engine is not capable of doing this at present, we should process transformations into Arris MAIN for urgent items using the alias MRB. 

In her email Grace noted that this will have the effect of increasing 14370, and decreasing 14360. Together these will net down to zero from an inventory roll-up perspective. 

Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks
NitaHi Nita

Instead of moving the quantity from CMARSNCM to CMARSNC (Dekit In transaction type), I have submitted the transformations to issue out the quantities from CMARSNCM and CMARSNC to avoid the confusion. I have reviewed the transformations to the best of my knowledge and they looks fine. You can go ahead and approve the transformations in IMS.

I have published the latest delta report as well. If you have any questions related to the report, please let me know.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Nita, 
I have confirmed that the items showing in oracle in CMARSNCM are the items that were moved to MRB location in the previous trials but only got dekit last month . 
GPNs and qty match with the list below provided by Aditya.

You may proceed to adjust them out from CMARSNCM

38594261,Send error report to warehouse for Oracle errors,"Hi Team,

WHNLAM3 warehouse operated by JDA-SYNCEON does not have any visibility for the failed shipments in Oracle. For example if a Shipment comes against a PO and has some issues related to serials and errors out in oracle, warehouse does not have any visibility of what happened to the shipment.

Will it be possible to generate a error report and send it to the warehouse.

Please let me  know if you have questions.

Appreciate your support.Hi Antara,

Do you need error report for ASN or PO receipts failures?

Can you please clarify why would WH need to know ASNs failing in Oracle? we are anyways not sending ASN to WH before processing it in Oracle.
Understand for Po receipts.
But the error report we send to other 3PLs is for errors related to MT/MR. So need to check if this can be done for PO receipts also.Hi Vikrant, 

Even when the ASN fails, the warehouse receives the actual physical shipment and in that case they cannot receive the goods until they have the ASN. If they have the error report they can act on it accordingly.

Please generate a report of both the ASN and PO Receipt errors.


Thanks
Antara

Hi Antara,

we donot send ASN report to any 3PL. Any ASN failure in oracle, we are creating auto GUTS to support team for early resolution.

We will check the PO receipt error report.Hi Aditya,

Can you please take a look at this request?Hi All

Looking at this request.. I shall provide you an update at the earliest.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Antara

If WH team is not able to see the order in their systems, they are reaching out to ascii team via GUTS. First they will log a ticket with 3PL's IT team and that request would be routed to ASCII group. IT team will work accordingly and update the ticket with issue details like ASN or Serial # issue etc. Even though we generate an error report, WH team will be reaching out to us via guts. So could you please let us know if an error report is still required as the team has a privilege to reach IT team via GUTS?

Also this issue has been observed by many users not just me and happens randomly from time to time i.e. MRB becomes too slow/unusablealso even if landing/home page works fine, other pages of the application i.e. search, mtr creation etc still hangThis needs some kind of deeper analysis and application maintenance/fix which can resolve the issue permanently.

Please help us on this one. This part is hanging on MRB for almost
3 weeks, it's bulky and we are running out of space. Let us know if maybe
we can just repeat the transactions, or allow us to process and ship it
despite having no inventory on Oracle side. Thanks.

I have adjusted in one unit of GPN 72003410-03-R and adjusted out
72005705-01-R on the 8th March, however I can still see the discrepancy in
between MIM stock and Oracle. Can you check if everything went correctly on

both stocks are balanced within few hours.

Hi Pravin

By now you know the drill. That serial that we reported was a serial that we physically received in our warehouse but it does not show in Gship as having been in our warehouse because you sent an ASN update for the MOR with which that serial was initially sent.

So please handle this in Gship

gShip status is still showing as ""Fully Shipped, Partially Received"".

May you please provide an update on when we should expect this issue to be resolved?

We cannot make the 2nd leg of an urgent shipment until this is completed.

Thank you,

KenHi XPO Delta team,

DBS has received different serials physically then what was reported on MT for Line 13 and 51.
MR is failing for this issue.
Can you please make sure correct serials are available at I% location so the MR can be processed.Relieve the reservations so I can fix the serials.
Please also provide the physical serials received.

Very strange, something must have happened during the transfer of the file because attached is the serials scanned on the outbound order.Hi - Please note that Urgent/High priority is reserved only for application down situation so we are downgrading the priority of this issue to Medium. If you strongly feel that this issue need immediate attention, please update the worklog with proper business justification.

Rest assured that team is working on each & every issue we are receiving for timely resolution.

Appreciate your support.Hi Tresa,

We have released reservation for line 13 and 51.

Here are the serials reported in MR by DBS:

Line 13:  182443 and 228745
Line 51: [)>?[?[06?[?[SEZ1812A2754
 

Valerie[)>?[?[06?[?[SEZ1812A2754 cannot be correct... Looks like a hole lot of extra stuff in front of serial SEZ1812A2754Hi Tresa,

Per our chat, we have changed the serials as follow:

Hi team,

I noticed a problem with CMTR0000952098.1. There are currently 30 pallet
IDs attached to this order, but as they are large pallets (135 x 80 x 132),
all of them won't fit into a sealed 13,6m trailer.

Could you remove from the order 3 x pallet IDs from this order?

PLTFIHEL191203167571
PLTFIHEL191203167304
PLTFIHEL191203167511

Order has appeared in SIMS, but it hasn't been completed and is still open.

Please note do not destroy these IDs, as they will be shipped forward in
other order in near future.

Regards,

Any update on this?+nemben who is current oncall.

Hi Bence,

Can you please check these ASNs for PO 536037. These are onhold in Oracle.Hi Vikrant,

The PO# has a mismatch about the serial numbers Footprints received and the actual quantities included in the shipment. Asn qty is 5631 and the serial number qty is 5498.
As a result, the outbound asn won't be auto issued.

Hi Vikrant,

Just a quick update, due to the mismatch, footprints moved that gpn to out of scope previously.
As of now, to issue the outbound asn, we need support from Oracle team.
Bence, feel free to correct me.Hi Mengchao,

let me know what needs to be done at Oracle side? Should we reprocess the ASNs again in oracle? will it again go for footprints hold?Yes, please reprocess that in Oracle.
No, it's  no longer in the scope of Footprints, it shouldn't be hold by footprints again.

Please let me know if it's hold again.Hello Vikrant,

Both RMITRIEDU and RMCNENLAM are not an inventory-location in Oracle, so nothing was systematically moved to RMITRIEDU.
Inventory was just issued out from WHNLAMSRK in gShip/Oracle.

Since MORSC4078886486 is already closed, it's not feasible to update the address.

Hi Valerie,

We've been advised by our PM that is not an inventory challenge but a financial challenge, as the inventory has been sold to the wrong party once creating the order for Dublin (even if physically is shipped to the correct party).
We want to know whats the financial impact on customer side to sale the inventory to the wrong party.
The RK team sold the parts based on PO under Remarket request RMKT-2019226286
Just to be sure we are managing this correctly, is there any way to void/cancel the order and reverse the stock in WHNLAMSRK so we can create a new MOR# for the correct location code?

Thank you
MeropiHi Meropi,

Yes, we can revert the MT transaction to move the stock back to WHNLAMSRK.

Will update this ticket once done.

Team,
There is a difference between quantities for GPN: 07028701-R - (gship vs
SIMS).
In gship there is a quantity of 5 pcs for GPN: 07028701-R which is shown as
allocated.
In SIMS the quantity is showing as received into the Inventory. Can you
receive the 5
in gship?

Dear Indira,

Please confirm if the linkage below includes the successful EDI 861 only?
For example, EDI 861 861005376 was successful in Quanta system, but we cannot find 861005376 in the linkage below.
So 861005376 failed in Googles system, and we need to resend it, is that right?

1. Delivery# 8025010187 - Supplier shipped only 2 units and ASN 8025010187 is reported only for 2 units (2pcs have delivered 3/8/19 via Graybar truck, signed by Jerome Nepulan.)
2. But we see 4 units are received / receipted in system on date 3/8/19, receipt# 162187 (2 units) and receipt# 162188 (2 units) (Please check and confirm)
3. When ASN 8025010187 is reported only for 2 units, how 4 units are received in system (Please check and confirm)

Now supplier shipped back order 3 units and reported ASN 8025181165 for 3 units (so no issues from supplier end)
Could you please check and advise on our query, so that we can work on how to handle this qty receiving challenge.

That is a good question that we cannot answer unfortunately here at the warehouse.  I have attached a screenshot of what we received into our system on ASN 8025010187, which clearly shows quantity 2 of GPN 1040222.

The PO is open for 5, so we should have another order for 3 of GPN 1040222 to be received.

We have only received quantity 2 of GPN 1040222 in SIMS.  I attached a screenshot on my last update showing the only receipt against GPN 1040222 for a quantity of 2.

We have not received it in twice as we have no order for the balance of 3 for GPN 1040222.

Please advise on how we may proceed.

Thank you,

KellyOracle Team,

WH team confirming that ""receipt is created only for one time for 2 units"". Don't know how the receipt is created for 2nd time for 2 units.
Please advise what can be done now to receipt the supplier shipped back order 2 units.


Hi Kelly / WH Team,
Please advise what can be done now to receipt the supplier shipped back order 2 units.

Regards,
KarthikGood Morning Karthik,

Unfortunately, there is nothing the warehouse can do to receipt the material without an order.  If we try to do any manual type order on this it will cause an inventory delta and you will not be able to view it on the Oracle side.

Whatever has been done on the Oracle side with the duplicate receipts needs to be reversed and we need an ASN generated to the Fremont warehouse to receipt the material.

For the time being it will sit until Oracle provides a resolution.

Regards,

KellyKarthik, looking at inventory portal... I'm seeing 2 units in PASSCAZ.
ascii team can tell us how they got there. I only see 2 units ever received in sims. +Brian for vis.

I could see that the Receiving Transaction Processor has processed receipts twice against line # 3, PO # 1010010781 in Oracle. It happens often times if there is any system glitch or outage at Oracle side. Among these two PO Receipt transactions, one has completely processed and the other one is partially processed. That is the reason of onhand 2u at PASS location.

Do we have any update from the WH team? So that I can analyse further.

Thanks,
AdityaHi Aditya,

Per WH comments (refer: kellyray on 03/21/2019 9:11):-
**We have only received quantity 2 of GPN 1040222 in SIMS.  I attached a screenshot on my last update showing the only receipt against GPN 1040222 for a quantity of 2.

Hi Tresa/Wh team/XPO IT/Oracle Team,
Could you please help in finding solution for the duplicate receipt issue.

Hi team,
Our CM - Inventec was not able to proceed with EDI 856.
Please advise why Inventec was able to proceed with PO Receipt EDI 856
against PO 512582 in multiple lines under the same GPN but not with PO
1010009757.
What was the different in EDI set up signal on these two POs that prevented
our CM from receiving it against PO 1010009757?

Thanks,
GuruHi Oracle Team,

For PO #512582 - We don't see any Purchase order or Acknowledgements flowing through our channel and also we have not sent outbound ASN to Inventec. We can only see the MRs reported by Inventec and these MRs look like blind MRs.

Fo PO #1010009757 - We have sent PO via e2open to supplier and received ASN inbound, and hence a corresponding Outbound ASN to Inventec was triggered via EDI. I can also see that Inventec has reported an MR for shipment #1010009757. I don't see these shipments anywhere in our BQ records. Hence I assume this also a blind MR which Inventec reported. 

Can you please check the setup details of Inventec. Looks like where ever we are reporting ASNs to them they are unable to receive and sent MRs to us.

We cannot reverse the assembly completion transaction.Other way around would be to create reverse transactions through IMS.If you have IMS access,Can you please go ahead and create the transactions ?

Thanks
Amit AminHi Amit, I don't have access. Don't even know what IMS is.

Hi Tiana, 
Is this something you can help with ? Please advise. Hi Tiana,

Can you pleas Helen to create transactions through IMS.

Thanks
Amit AminHi Tiana,

Can you please help Helen to create transactions through IMS.

Thanks
Amit AminHi Tiana,

Can you pleas Helen to create transactions through IMS.

Thanks
Amit AminHI Amit,
I don't do assembly completion so either Tiana and team or Norm have to process that transaction.

HI Tiana and Norm, 
Please process what's needed so we can get this resolved. Appreciate it.Using go/ims I am able to view some current inventory counts (similar to Inventory Portal in go/scportal) but I don't see any way to modify them.
In particular I cannot see the current count for GPN 1025651-02 at CMGONY1P.  Where go/scportal shows me a count of -66 (negative 66), go/ims just says 'No results.'
I can see some shipment transactions for 1025651-02 from WHGAOAKP -> CMGONY1P, and for gpn 1027739-02 from CMGONY1P -> WHGAOAKP, I don't see anything that looks like the 'assembly complete' operation that transforms 1025651-02 into 1027739-02.Hi Helen/Norm,

As of now,I see the below onhand quantity at location ""CMGONY1P"" :

1025651-02    -66qty
1027739-02    70 qty

But the reversal which is requested is for 89 qty.I see that the below MOR's were reported for 1027739-02 :

MT:MORSC4071861955 : 1 : gShip190220151615347-6039054 :  :

MT:MORSC4067423691 : 1 : gShip190205145321839-147673 :  : 


I see that the below IMS transactions was performed for 21qty  for 1025651-02 :

IMS: 7ae7a2ec-8b0b-4539-b678-7e638859fa23 | 3106111249637494096.

If we perform reversals,the it will result in negative onhand for 1027739-02 in ""CMGONY1P"" location.

Thanks
Amit Amin
Hi Amit,
What we're really trying to do here is get the onhand quantities of 1025651-02 and 1027739-02 at CMGONY1P back to zero -- in whatever way works best.
If there is some way to edit the current counts without reversing previous transactions, that would be fine.
The discrepancy in counts (66 vs. 70) is due to a small number of parts which failed during preparation/testing (3) and one which was allocated for non-production uses (1).
I'm not sure how to represent those losses in terms of our inventory system, but those 4 cards are definitely not available for use anymore.

Thanks,
NormHi,

Can you let me know which account do I need to use in performing the below transaction to make the overall count as 0 ?  If you can provide me the account code,then I can go ahead and perform the transactions.

Thanks
Amit AminI'm afraid I don't know what the account code is.  I generally use the ""Assembly Completion"" screen in go/scportal to do my work.  
An example work order is SCP35354, and the PO # was 5000071, if that helps.
Let me check and try to perform the transactions.I will provide you an update soon.

Thanks
Amit AminHi Helen/Norm,

Quantities for 1027739-02 and 1025651-02 have been set to 0 at location CMGONY1P.

Please check and confirm and let me know if you need any further assistance from support team.

Thanks
Amit AminExcellent.  Thanks!

After checking these order in gship, I found out that you processed and shipped these from gShip where as XPO never received the EDI files to process these from WMS systems, Can you please advise why these were transacted in gShip Gui? Any how this need to be fixed now. Orders were never shipped from Oakley I believe.

The difference that I can see is the address used for repair. The ""NA"" location is the US location and the ""CN"" is the China location for returns.

I have corrected the location codes for these GPNs. If you rescan the part in DejaVu, it should output the right location.

Here's the comments from DBS as below and could you please check this?

We show the lines have been sent ICN 000015419 gShip will need to be adjusted on pandora side.
Since we show the correct matching qty's being sent in DBS side.

File was transmitted with correct qty's for lines 6 and 8

Thank you.
Ran LeeHi Lee, The issue is you have fully received for line 6 and 8 of MORSC4068617252 in JDA.
That means line 6 with 2 units and 
line 8 with 8 units but
as per the below comment transmitted qty's are 4 and 1
Only. 
So do you want to short close the order with 4 and 1 only /OR full 8 and 2. 
If it has to be closed with 8 and 2 units, JDA needs to report the remaining units.
And also confirm what needs to be adjusted.

File was transmitted with correct qty's for lines 6 and 8

Hi Jiten,

We added the Inventory as below for each line in our WMS and confirmed the physical qty is matched with below detail.

LINE#6 07024104 - Adding 1 QTY, so total is 2
LINE#8 07096147 - Adding 4 QTY, so total is 8

So please not to short close and could you please adjust inventory qty at your end that fully received condition?

Requisition # 961949 is an imported requisition and the PO # 518967 has been created against the same.
I could see that preparer of this requisition is 'Gaurav Bhamri' (bhamri@) and hence you see him as a requester in the PIVT.

If you would like to have any additional information, please let me know.

Req# 961949 was not released by Gaurav. As informed earlier PO-518967 is OSP and it's created manually in Oracle. The req is generated once the AC is completed.

Now can you please let me know how the req preparer is fetched in OSP PO.

Thanks, ShyamHi Shyam

Oracle back-end is showing me the preparer of this requisition # 961949 is 'Gaurav Bhamri' (bhamri@).
Please schedule a quick sync on this. I can explain you in detail by showing the data in Oracle.

Hi Hilda,

For the following PO 91117137 we have received one more shipment SH #83823142 which failed to process at our end as the shipment contains a GPN and a serial number combination which was already processed at our end.
For the previous shipment you have told us that the shipment is being manually received. Please let us know if this shipment also is being received manually ?
If 'Yes' please don't sent us shipments via EDI for manual shipments, they cause unnecessary attentions at our end.
If 'No' can you please correct and re send this shipment.

Thanks.

After checking the rework list, I found that SN 8A1X0K3VZ still is B1 rework device which I have sent an list to you before.

Now there are 5 piece device SN failed to process in your end which is included in the rework list. In order to avoid this duplicate issue, could you please double confirm in your end whether these SN has been marked in you Oracle? Thanks for your help!

Let me check if the below serial has been processed before in Oracle.

I see that shipment # 83823142 has been reported with duplicate serial numbers. I have tried to reprocess it by voiding the duplicate serials. However, the ASN has multiple serials with same GPN #. All the serials have been marked to OLD in the shipment. I will reply to the email asking to report a new shipment with valid serials.

As there is no pending action on IT team, I am going ahead with marking this ticket as resolved. Please reopen or file a new ticket if you need any further assistance on this.

Can we please have this order closed out so that we can process the allocated inventory through new orders?Good Morning, this order is still in canceled/pending notification status in gship. Please assist with closing out this order so that its allocated inventory can be reprocessed. Hi Pravin,

One order MORSC4080349565  shows successfully cancelled in gship and voided in SIMS.

Second order MORSC4080770055 failed to drop into XPO because the file sent shows errored  out into BQ . So you can force close this in gship as this never dropped. See the screen shot for reference.
